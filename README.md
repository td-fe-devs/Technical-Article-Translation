## Way to develop
Since gitbook cli is no longer under active development, we use hotkit instead.
* Run `npm i` to install dependencies.
* Run `npm run init` to initialize honkit.
* Run `npm run start` to start gitbook locally.
* Run `npm run deploy` to deploy changes with surge.(It is just a temporary way to deploy)
